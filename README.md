//09-16-22
//we Create a brand new console project that takes a sequence of numbers and reverses them.
//Then user will enter the number.

peer review: Arely Martinez -- The program works well when I enter in a sigle digit number or a sequence of digits. However there is an issue where the program completely ends if I enter a group of numbers with space involved. Im unsure if wasn't a requirement bc i did the string and numbers, its just a small error. There is also no data validation for if the user enter a vaild number. So I would type in some characters and the program would end.
